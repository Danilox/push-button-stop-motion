## Hardware

As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian, you'll also need:

- 1 x [Raspberry Pi camera module](http://www.raspberrypi.org/product/camera-module/)
- 1 x Solderless breadboard (e.g. from [Pimoroni](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/colourful-mini-breadboard))
- 2 x Male-to-female jumper leads (e.g. from [Pimoroni](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/jumper-jerky))
- 1 x Tactile button (e.g. from [RS Components](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/tactile-switches/7182443/))
