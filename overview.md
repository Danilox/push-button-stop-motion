In this resource, you will make your own stop motion animation machine that includes a Raspberry Pi and Pi camera to take pictures with a push button connected to the Pi's GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins to act as a trigger to take the pictures. To achieve this you will connect the camera, and a button with jumper wires to your Pi and write some Python code in order to control them.
