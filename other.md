# Other Information

## Rendering options

The rendering process is intensive and with many frames can take a long time on the Pi. You may wish to render the video on another computer using general video editing software such as Movie Maker on Windows, iMovie on Mac or `mencoder` on Linux.

## Python 2 compatibility

This worksheet works fine in both Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 is recommended but if you require Python 2 for an extension of the worksheet, simply use the equivalent Python 2 packages when installing. See the [software installation](software.md) page.
